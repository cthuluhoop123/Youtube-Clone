                Once upon a midnight dreary,
                while i pondered weak and weary,
                Over many a quaint and curious
                volume of forgotten lore,
    
                While I nodded, nearly napping,
                suddenly there came a tapping,
                As of some one gently rapping,
                rapping at my chamber door.
    
                `'Tis some visitor,` I muttered,
                `tapping` at my chamber door -
                Only this, and nothing more.`
    
                Page not found: 404.
